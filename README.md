What is it?
2 3D print files, code and a diagram to make some buttons and lights for a kids toy. The button presses start 2 different sounds and the switch simply turns on LEDs.

Problems:
The DFplayer is incredibly unreliable and troublesome. It almost makes the final product annoying. The Arduino Uno is able to be powered by a variety of external devices, but causes the DFplayer to malfunction. Only powered by a laptop or a battery pack does the DFplayer work.
